            <p>
                Programs can be interesting even if they don't interact with the user, but people often get tired of
                them pretty quickly. <em>Disc</em> language provides two ways of accepting user input. We will take a
                look at both of them on this page, and use them in small programs. This information will be useful as
                example code and tutorials get more complicated.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="prompt">
            <h3 id="prompt">Prompting</h3>

            <p>
                Prompting the user is how you can collect typed answers from the user. In the browser, you will see a
                prompt dialog pop up, which will allow users to enter information from the keyboard.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can enhance our original "Hello, World" program with a prompt. In this example, we will add a prompt
                to get the user's name, and then greet them directly. Let's take a look.
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
begin
    let name be prompt: "What is your name?"
    let message be join: "Hello, " name "!"
    print: message 
end
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>
                Read this code aloud and think about what it does. We have some new pieces to understand. Let's have a
                look at each of them and what they do for the program.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you think you get it, head over to the <a href="../build.html">create something area, and try writing it yourself!</a>
            </p>

            <section aria-labelledby="let-be-construct">
                <h4 id="let-be-construct">let ... be ...</h4>

                <p>
                    The "let ... be ..." construct is known as <em>variable initialization</em>. That's a fancy way of
                    saying we're giving some value a name so we can refer to it later. The grammar in this code works like
                    this:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>let</em> -- this says we are going to create a new variable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>... (name)</em> -- the first set of ellipses is where the variable name goes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>be</em> -- this is referred to as <em>assignment</em>. This means we are assigning a value to
                        the name we gave the variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>... (value)</em> -- This is the value assigned to our new variable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section aria-labelledby="join-function">
                <h4 id="join-function">Join</h4>

                <p>
                    The <code>join</code> function takes several values and sticks them all together as a single string. This behavior is known as <em>concatenation</em>. In this program we are using <code>join</code> to combine the hello message and the name we received from the user.
                </p>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="readkey">
            <h3 id="readkey">readKey</h3>

            <p>
                The <code>readKey</code> function is a way to capture single key strokes from a user. This can be especially useful for menus and other quick interactions with the user. Something that is common is the "press any key to continue...". This can be implemented with the <code>readKey</code> function.
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
begin
    print: "****************************"
    print: "* My Program Splash Screen *"
    print: "****************************"

    print: ""
    print: "Press any key to continue..."

    (readKey:)
end
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>
                The code above will print out a splash screen, and then wait for the user to press a key before continuing. If you run the "To Do List", "Game of Life", or "Rule 110" programs, you will see a splash screen like this. I opted for a countdown timer, but the <code>readKey</code> function would also work quite well.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>readKey</code> function also returns the key pressed by the user. The following code will print any key the user presses:
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
begin
    print: "Press a key: "
    let pressedKey be (readKey:)

    print: ""
    print: join: "You pressed: " pressedKey
end
                </pre>
            </code>
        </section>

            <p>
                The ideas presented in this section are other ways to think about the code you write. Some of the ideas here may not feel like a better approach, and that's okay. Ideally what you will discover is, there is always another way to solve the same problem.

            <section aria-labelledby="combining-functions">
                <h4 id="combining-functions">Combining Functions</h4>

                <p>
                    When you are feeling confident with each piece of this program, try combining functions together to get the same behavior. Though it is not always advisable to combine lots of complicated behavior together on a single line, sometimes the program makes more sense when functions are combined in useful ways. The following examples are different ways of writing the same program. Read them aloud and see which makes the most sense to you!
                </p>

                <code>
                    <pre>
begin
    let name be prompt: "What is your name?"

    # we moved message "inline" eliminating the variable
    print: join: "Hello, " name "!" 
end
                    </pre>
                </code>

                <code>
                    <pre>
begin
    # Here, the entire program is written on one line.
    print: join: "Hello, " (prompt: "What is your name?") "!" 
end
                    </pre>
                </code>
