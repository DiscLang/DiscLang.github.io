            This page is for design information about <em>disc</em> lang, and contains little information that a
            beginning programmer would find helpful. If you want to find out more about the design choices of the
            language, or if you want to build your own language at some point, this page may be interesting to you.
            After all, we are all beginners at something!

            <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration for <em>disc</em> Lang Look and Feel</h3>

            <p>
                In the discussion on the home page, I discussed where I originally got the idea for creating
                <em>disc</em> lang in the first place. However, I took inspiration from languages which already exist to
                create the overall hand-feel, so to speak. In alphabetical order, I drew inspiration from:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>BASIC</li>
                <li>Haskell</li>
                <li>Lisp</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>Io</li>
                <li>Scala</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Some of these languages are expressed more predominantly in the visual aspects of programs written in
                <em>disc</em> lang. Others provided insight into how I might steer into, or away from, a certain
                practice, pattern, or internal behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of the final design was to blend learning, and a natural flow of the language. A novice
                programmer would, ideally, understand how the parts of the language fit together, so long as they speak
                English. (More on this later.) An experienced programmer would, ideally, see the natural start and end
                of concepts within the language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Programming should be fun! I borrowed against the idea, in Ruby, that a programming language would
                provide a fun while programming with it. Hopefully <em>disc</em> lang delivered on that promise. I spent
                many hours writing programs in order to find places where behaviors felt odd, out of place, or simply
                misnamed. My hope is this paid off.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div aria-labelledby="#behavior">
            <h3 id="behavior">Language Behaviors</h3>

            <p>
                The behavior of <em>disc</em> lang should be predictable, before all else. The behavioral goal of
                <em>disc</em> lang was to create a smooth, normalized behavioral experience with as few warts as I could
                manage. No language is perfect, and this one is no different. Nevertheless, it should be reasonable to
                explore any programming concept in the small with <em>disc</em> lang.
            </p>

            <p>
                Choices of programming guidance were made. Since <em>disc</em> lang is intended to be an accessible
                first programming language, there were affordances built into the language to help people discover the
                kinds of mistakes which can easily lead to very long debugging sessions. This list is a set of certain
                key ideas.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Obvious block demarcation
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every block must conclude with an <code>end</code> statement on its own line</li>
                        <li>Failure to include an <code>end</code> for any block is a parse error, and will halt
                            execution</li>
                        <li>Messaging is as clear as possible about what was missed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Functions are first class, but...
                    <ul>
                        <li>Functions are treated as values for any program</li>
                        <li>Anonymous functions do not exist; all functions must be declared by name</li>
                        <li>All functions are defined as constant within their scope, preventing accidental overwriting
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Variable types are invariant
                    <ul>
                        <li>All types are dynamically managed at runtime</li>
                        <li>Once a variable is initialized, its type is strongly enforced; e.g. if a variable id
                            initialized with a string, it can only ever store strings</li>
                        <li>All variables must be initialized with an acceptable value; this ensures a variable always
                            has a sensible default value</li>
                        <li>All of this is to ensure the novice programmer receives appropriate messaging when they do
                            something which could lead to an error</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Reading over rigidity
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are more core functions than operators, operators tend to be less flexible</li>
                        <li>Optional reader-friendly alternatives, for example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Function call versus colon: <code>call functionName with arg1 arg2</code> versus
                                    <code>functionName: arg1 arg2</code></li>
                                <li>Standard call versus infix notation: <code>between: testValue min max</code> versus
                                    <code>:: value between min max</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Alternative notation can be ignored for the sake of consistency or reader normalization</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
